To-Do List Application
Overview
In this assignment, you will create a simple To-Do List application in Python. This project will allow you to practice your Python programming skills, particularly in working with lists, user input, and file handling. The To-Do List application will enable you to add tasks, remove tasks, list tasks, and save tasks to a file.

The Power of Python Lists
Python lists are versatile and powerful data structures that can be used to store and manipulate collections of items. They are dynamic and flexible, allowing you to add, remove, and modify elements easily. In this project, you'll harness the strength of Python lists to create a functional To-Do List application.

Instructions
Clone the Repository:

Clone the starter repository for this project from Git
You will find the initial template code in the repository. The code includes a basic structure for the To-Do List application, but you'll need to complete it.
Set Up a PyCharm Project:

Open PyCharm (make sure you have it installed; you can download it from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
Create a new PyCharm project for this assignment.
Add the cloned repository as your project's directory.
Complete the Code:

Inside PyCharm, open the provided Python script in your project.
You will see comments marked with # TODO in the code. These comments indicate where you need to write code to make the application functional.
Implement the functions for loading tasks from a file, adding tasks, removing tasks, listing tasks, and saving tasks to a file.
Run and Test:

After completing the code, run the To-Do List application from PyCharm.
Test each menu option (Add Task, Remove Task, List Tasks, Quit) to ensure that your application functions correctly.
Submission:

Once you have finished the project, submit your code by pushing your changes to the repository.
